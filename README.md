# Daiz's Noita mods

My personal mod collection for [Noita](https://noitagame.com/). You can install the mods by downloading this repository as a zip file and then extracting the results to your `[NOITA_GAME_PATH]\mods` folder. As for mods currently available:

## Always Edit Wands Everywhere

Start with Edit Wands Everywhere. Should also remove it from the Holy Mountain perk pool.

## Always Faster Movement

Start with Faster Movement. Does not remove the perk from the HM perk pool as it is stackable.

## Perk Hoarder

Start with Perk Lottery (and remove it from HM perk pool). Holy Mountain also has four perks by default rather than three.

## Bigger Inventory (2x/3x/4x)

Increases your inventory size by 2x/3x/4x. Only enable one of these at a time.

## Increased Starting HP

Increases your starting HP to 200. I was tired of always getting the Lava Lake Orb, Shrine Orb and Pyramid Orb along with the top darkness HP pickup in mines, so I made this to "simulate" getting them so I could get to actually playing the main game faster. However, you might prefer the following mod instead...

## Start with Familiar Orbs

The 11 main orbs are now "permanently" collected when found. This means starting each run with the orbs already collected, along with the max HP that comes with them, ie. if you have found all 11 orbs, you start with 25 \* 11 = 275 extra max HP for a total of 375 HP.
